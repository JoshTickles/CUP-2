# CUP-2



A modified version of CreateUserPackage that incorperates changes submitted to main repository that were not merged. Essentially SHA1 has been replaced with PBKDF2 by Greg Neagle.

This is *not recommended* for personal use at all and this is prone to break with out warning.

This is not an offical version and the builds are for my personal use only.
