# CUP-2

-----------

A modified version of CreateUserPackage that incorperates changes submitted to main repository that were not merged. Essentially SHA1 has been replaced with PBKDF2 by Greg Neagle.

This is *not recommended* for professional / production use at all and this is prone to break with out warning.

This is not an offical version, the builds are for my personal use only and come with no support or warranty!.
